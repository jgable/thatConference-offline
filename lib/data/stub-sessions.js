You can test your page in a responsive environment, explore new technologies, and give your clients a better sense of the final product.  Rapid prototyping also affords you the opportunity to design with content first and build your site from mobile up.\r\n\r\nIn this session learn how to rapid prototype websites and applications in a snap.

We will look at writeable computed observables and some of the additional options that computed observables support.  We will also take an extensive look at an indispensable tool, custom bindings, and demonstrate different scenarios where they are a good fit.

As a career web developer, I've watched as my beloved development platform has grown from a web of pages and static content to a web of applications and cutting-edge user experiences. At the same time, as more and more applications move their front-ends into the browser, the \"real\" work of desktop development has waned. Mobile device development has managed to carve itself a nice niche, thanks to the app-centric reinvention of platforms, though each platform ships a proprietary environment with custom tools and programming languages.\r\n\r\nBut \"the web is\" pervasive. And even on devices, the web has proliferated; with frameworks like PhoneGap/Cordova and Titanium Appcelerator enabling developers to craft Native Mobile applications using, you guessed it, web technologies like HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Boldly, Microsoft has doubled-down on this \"putting the web on devices\" bet by making HTML, JavaScript and CSS a first-class, platform- and tool-supported citizen for Windows 8. It's now possible to build native applications--replete with access to device APIs and sensors--with the HTML, JavaScript and CSS you use every day. The only question is, should you?", "Level": "200", "ScheduledRoom": "Mangrove", "Category": "Web", "ScheduledDateTime": "\/Date(1344886200000)\/", "People": [

Manufacturers are now cramming more pixels-per-inch into their devices, providing remarkable abilities to render beautiful images and crisp text.\r\n \r\nHowever, high pixel density devices, such as the new iPad with its Retina display, are only able to view images at the quality given by the webpage. Without any consideration for high-density displays, webpages are wasting the true beauty of these devices by only allowing them to render blurry poor-quality images. And what makes matters worse is that traditional monitors, such as the machine you may develop on, are often unable to show the difference between image resolutions.\r\n\r\nThis session will help you understand the difference between image pixels, CSS pixels, and device pixels, and what you can do today to develop webpages that can render high quality images on high-density displays.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to understanding device pixel ratio, this session will also demonstrate practical examples for today\u2019s browsers:\r\n- Pixel doubling\r\n- CSS media queries\r\n- Foresight.js: Javascript solution for hi-res content images on today\u2019s browsers\r\n- Alternatives:\r\n--- Background Gradients\r\n--- Web fonts\r\n--- Icon fonts\r\n--- SVG", "Level": "200", "ScheduledRoom": "Guava", "Category": "Mobile", "ScheduledDateTime": "\/Date(1344891600000)\/", "People": [

The web developer/development team is most often looked upon to build native applications for multiple devices/platforms. However most web developers/designers are not familiar with how to build a native iOS or Android app, much less both.

Put down your Arduino, your Netduino, your Raspberry Pi and your soldering iron and come and learn why the world of Robotics needs you and your software. Is there really a robotic revolution coming and how can you be part of it?\r\n\r\nOver a few short years Microsoft has built a development system for creating robotic applications. Want a robotic car than can drive across a dessert with no driver...done that. Want a robotic submarine that can complete tasks underwater with no human intervention...check. Want to simulate a rover driving across Mars or a car driving through a simulated city? Yes done that as well.\r\n\r\nEvery week we seem to inch closer to the start of the robot revolution but what is it really about? Is there really a revolution coming and how can you be part of it?\r\n\r\nDuring this talk I will cover Microsoft Robotics then and now and how a sensor called Kinect is creating unique opportunities. I will also cover how you can generate a robotic application using VPL or Visual Programming Language and how this can be the start of your robotic programming journey.\r\n\r\nWhen the world market for home based robots explodes there will be a huge demand for software solutions. It\u2019s time to either start paying attention or be overtaken by the next \u201ckiller\u201d robotic application and its more than being able to clean your carpet but even that could be interesting\r\n\r\nFinally did you know 10 teams around the world are competing in a project to deliver a home solution for robotics? You will see updates from these teams and perhaps spark a few ideas of your own.\r\n\r\nJoining me for this talk will be The Lego NXT, The Parallax S2 and the Microsoft EDDIE robotic platform,.", "Level": "100", "ScheduledRoom": "G", "Category": "Other", "ScheduledDateTime": "\/Date(1344978000000)\/", "People": [

Are you tired of using Java for everything?  Have you been looking for an excuse to learn Groovy?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, this session is for you.  Heck, even if you answered no I think you'll learn something from this session.\r\n\r\nWe all unit test our code (right? right!), however this can be a laborious process using typical Java unit testing strategies.  Java, as a language, is great at a lot of things, however it does have it's shortcomings including: verbosity, lack of dynamism, and only classes being first class citizens.  All of these shortcomings conspire to hinder your ability to quickly and efficiently unit test your code.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I will show you how to use Groovy to unit your test your Java code.  We will discuss what makes Groovy a perfect language for writing unit tests for Java code.  We will discuss mock object strategies, how java mock object frameworks are limited in their expressiveness due to Java, and how to use the dynamic features of Groovy to quickly and easily create mock objects.  I will also show how creating standard data structures (lists, maps, etc.) for testing in Groovy is much simpler and faster.  And, we will then see some of the built-in assertion capabilities Groovy has that eliminate the need for boilerplate code in all our unit tests.\r\n\r\n", "Level": "200", "ScheduledRoom": "Aralia", "Category": "Other", "ScheduledDateTime": "\/Date(1344978000000)\/", "People": [

Tim and Keith will share openly and honestly about the tools they are using daily to maximize the experience and uncover \"truth\" in their customers.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterestingly great website design is much aligned with the Hells Angels motto: \"When we do right, nobody remembers.

What\u2019s so bad about the Comic Sans font?  \r\n\r\nDuring this session, I will dive into a few basic topics such as the four basic design principles that create the CRAP acronym, including what they are, what each one is referencing when it comes to product and application design, and examples of each.  \r\n\r\nI will also discuss the selection and use of color in design.  Certain colors promote different emotions in people, some that are positive and some that are negative.  Finding the colors that promote the right emotion is only the first step because you also have to make sure that the colors work well together.  There\u2019s an expiation why the idea of purple and red seems more aesthetic than purple and yellow, but when you actually see the colors together, purple and yellow just works. \r\n\r\nAnd the final topic will be typography.  People may already know the difference between a Serif font and a San Serif font, but you should also know whether or not you can use both types in a single application or how many different fonts should be used in an application. \r\n", "Level": "100", "ScheduledRoom": "F", "Category": "Other", "ScheduledDateTime": "\/Date(1345044600000)\/", "People": [

One problem with the Canvas, though, is that the rendered image is just that: an image.  The user is unable to interact with any of the shapes that are drawn to the Canvas.  However, an open source library called Kinetic bridges that gap, allowing shapes or images to be drawn using the existing Canvas API, event listeners attached to them, and manipulated individually using mouse or touch (i.e., move, scale, and rotate).

In this session we will demonstrate how these three anti-heroes can join together to form an effective, non-traditional, badass way of building beautiful, scalable, maintainable systems. \r\n\r\nWhat is CQRS? CQRS is an architectural pattern with two goals 1) commit technological heresy 2) separate reads from writes at the system level. What's Erlang? An industry-proven functional programming language that simplifies writing reliable, concurrent, distributed systems. What's .NET? OK, stop with the silly questions.\r\n\r\nWell why these three? Many of the ideas of CQRS dovetail perfectly with the sweet-spots of Erlang... er, um... until you get to the UI part. Erlang doesn't have much to say about the CQRS tenet of task-based UIs, but Microsoft does\u2014 search \"Microsoft Inductive User Interface\" and you'll see what I mean.
